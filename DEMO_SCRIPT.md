## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script (5-7 minutes)

### **Opening (30 seconds)**

*"Hi! I'm excited to present SensAI Commerce - our submission for the Sensay Connect Hackathon E-Commerce track."*

*"We've built a complete AI-powered e-commerce platform that demonstrates exactly what the challenge asked for: a chatbot that guides customers, answers questions, tracks cart intent, upsells products, and provides post-sale support."*

---

### **Platform Overview (1 minute)**

**[Show main page: localhost:3000]**

*"Here's our live e-commerce platform. Notice the AI chat widget in the bottom right - this is powered by real Sensay API integration."*

*"You can see our status indicator in the navigation showing we're connected to the Sensay backend."*

*"Let me show you the key features that make this special..."*

---

### **Feature 1: AI Customer Support (1.5 minutes)**

**[Click chat widget]**

*"First, let's test our AI customer assistant. I'll ask it a typical customer question."*

**[Type: "Can you help me find wireless headphones under $100?"]**

*"Watch this - I'm getting a real response from Sensay's AI, not a simulation. The AI understands context and provides helpful information."*

**[Show the response and status indicators]**

*"Notice the real-time status indicators showing the AI is online and responding. This chat works 24/7 and can handle multiple customers simultaneously."*

---

### **Feature 2: Cart Abandonment Recovery (1.5 minutes)**

**[Navigate to localhost:3000/test]**

*"Now let's see our cart abandonment recovery system. This is our test dashboard where I can demonstrate all the AI features."*

**[Click "Test Cart Recovery"]**

*"I'm simulating a cart abandonment scenario. Watch what happens..."*

**[Show the success response]**

*"The AI immediately detected the abandonment and generated a personalized recovery message. In a real scenario, this would be sent via email, SMS, or the customer's preferred channel."*

*"This happens automatically in the background - no manual intervention needed."*

---

### **Feature 3: Real-time Integration Testing (1 minute)**

**[Show other test features]**

*"Our platform integrates with all the Sensay features. Let me test the AI chat functionality..."*

**[Type a message in the chat test area]**

*"And here's our user profile system..."*

**[Fill in name/email and test profile update]**

*"Everything you see is connected to real Sensay APIs, not mock data. This is a production-ready integration."*
